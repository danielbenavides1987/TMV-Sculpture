Master Prompt: TMV - Turismo Médico Venezuela by Sculpture
Application Name: TMV

Slogan: Turismo Médico Venezuela by Sculpture

Language: Spanish (Primary) and English (Toggle).

Objective:
Develop a premium, full-stack web application to manage a 360-degree medical tourism service. The platform must facilitate interaction between Patients, Doctors, and a System Admin to coordinate surgeries, luxury lodging in allied hotels, and logistics.

1. Multi-Role Architecture & Navigation
A. Patient View (El Cliente)
Landing & Onboarding: Professional UI with a statistical pop-up about Venezuela's medical quality.

Doctor Directory: Searchable list. Each profile displays:

Professional Biography (Dual language).

CV Download/View (PDF).

Image Gallery (Certificates and clinic facilities).

Label: "Consulta con Costo" or "Consulta de Cortesía".

Dynamic Package Configurator: Once a surgery is proposed, the patient accesses an interactive panel to:

Select an Allied Hotel (Gallery + Price per night).

Input Number of Stay Days (Live calculation).

Toggle VIP Logistics (Airport pickup/Local transport).

Toggle Personalized Meal Plan (3 meals/day).

Contact Logic: If Logistics or Meals are toggled, an input field asks for the preferred WhatsApp number (defaults to registration phone unless changed).

Payment Module: Form to report Zelle, PayPal, or Bank Transfers (Input for Reference #, Bank, Amount, Date, and Screenshot/Receipt upload).

B. Doctor View (El Especialista)
Profile Management: Interface to upload/update CV (PDF), bio, and image gallery.

Clinical Desk: Portal to view patient-uploaded medical history and a specialized form to fill out the History/Diagnosis during the consultation.

Proposal Generator: A tool to submit the technical medical cost of a surgery (Doctor fees + Supplies) to the Admin for review.

C. Admin View (El Máster - Centro de Mando)
Payment Verification: A checklist dashboard to approve/reject reported payments (2-24h window).

Quote/Logistics Editor: Receives doctor proposals, attaches selected Allied Hotel costs, and sets flat fees for transport. Finalizes the package before the patient sees it.

Concierge CRM: A high-priority list of patients who requested Meals/Logistics. Displays their chosen WhatsApp number with a "Click to Chat" direct link.

Alliance Manager: CRUD system to add/edit Allied Hotels (Name, Price, Photos, Services).

2. Business Logic & Workflows
The 3-Step Quote Flow:

Doctor submits medical proposal -> Status: Under Admin Review.

Admin adds Hotel options and Logistics -> Status: Ready for Patient.

Patient configures days/meals -> Status: Pending Payment.

Price Calculation Formula: Total = Surgery_Base_Cost + (Hotel_Price_Night * Days) + (Meal_Plan_Price * Days) + Logistics_Fee.

Multilingual Support: All static text and dynamic content (Bios/Services) must have fields for both Spanish and English. The app defaults to Spanish.

Human Touch Trigger: Activating the "Meal Plan" or "Logistics" toggle creates a task for the Admin to contact the patient via WhatsApp within 24-48h for personalization.

3. Technical Requirements (For Replit Agent)
Stack: Next.js (Frontend), Supabase/PostgreSQL (Database & Auth), Tailwind CSS (UI).

Database Tables:

Users: ID, Email, Role (Admin/Doctor/Patient), Language.

Doctor_Profiles: Bio, CV_URL, Image_List, Fees.

Hotel_Alliances: Name, Price_Night, Meal_Price, Photos.

Quotes: Patient_ID, Doctor_ID, Surgery_Cost, Stay_Days, Hotel_ID, Extras_Toggle, Total, Status.

Payments: Quote_ID, Reference_Num, Receipt_Image, Status.

UI/UX: Premium aesthetic (Sculpture Branding). Use teal, surgical blue, and white space. Ensure mobile responsiveness.
